# mandrake

`{mandrake}` is an R package that aims to bridge the gap between:
* the **man**ual & the [`{**drake**}`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) workflow, &
* your `code`'s documentation & your data's documentation. 

`{mandrake}` extends the communication tools provided by `{drake}` & supercharges them into a way to quickly describe
your workflows at both a bird's eye view, & in intimate detail.

`{mandrake}` also extends [`{roxygen2}`](https://github.com/r-lib/roxygen2/) to allow you to use the standard `{roxygen2}` documentation workflow to document
your datasets in the same place that you create them, as well as the tools to inherit this dataset documentation around
packages with minimal effort.
