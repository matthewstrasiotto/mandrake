# mandrake 0.0.0.9001

Initial Dev Version

## Implementations

- Implement target-doc extraction function `extract_column_names()`
  - This uses the plan and the cache to extract column names from each target,
  - and returns the plan with a new list-col containing that target's variable names.

## Demonstrations

- Add demo article "Test Usecase", showing the ability to embed metadata about a specific
  target directly into the network graph
