# mandrake

`{mandrake}` is an R package that aims to bridge the gap between:
* the **man**ual & the [`{**drake**}`](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) workflow, &
* your `code`'s ‚å®Ô∏è  documentation & your data's üìà documentation. 

`{mandrake}` extends the communication tools provided by `{drake}` & supercharges to connect directly with
your workflows at both an eage-eye view, & in intimate detail.

`{mandrake}` also extends [`{roxygen2}`](https://github.com/r-lib/roxygen2/) to allow you to use the standard `{roxygen2}` documentation workflow to document
your datasets in the same place that you create them, as well as the tools to inherit this dataset documentation around
packages with minimal effort.
